# Precius-Project
Precius is an OS security solution. 
This solution is accurately an security module "encapsulator" open-source and ultra-configurable for Windows. It's a lightweight solution, it doesn't do anything until it's specifically configured .

Precius allows you to import your own security modules made in any language, whether it's from GitHub, an existing and known module, or a completely home-made module. It has a sector system that allows you to indicate which context folders and modules should be used. This allows you to perfectly control the use and the computing power of the modules, and thus of Precius in general.
